The issue is often caused by detaching the listener too early or not handling asynchronous operations correctly.  The improved code ensures the listener is properly attached and detached at appropriate times.  Additionally, it may involve using promises or async/await to handle asynchronous operations properly.

```javascript
//firebaseBugSolution.js
let unsubscribe = null;
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(user => {
  if (unsubscribe) {
    unsubscribe();
  }
  unsubscribe = firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(user => {
     //handle user
  });
});
```
