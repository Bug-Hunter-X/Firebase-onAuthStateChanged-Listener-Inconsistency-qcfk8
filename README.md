This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener: inconsistent triggering upon authentication changes.  The `firebaseBug.js` file shows the problematic code, where the listener may fail to detect authentication state transitions. The solution, provided in `firebaseBugSolution.js`, addresses this by ensuring proper listener management and handling potential race conditions.
